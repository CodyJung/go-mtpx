To run tests copy the `tests/mtp-test-files` to your phone's `root`

It should look like: 
```
/ 
 - mtp-test-files
    - mock_dir1
    - mock_dir2
    - mock_dir3
    - mock_dir4
```

- open the Files app on your phone
- Navigate to `mtp-test-files/mock_dir1`
- Create a new file by the name: `[-----DS_Store.mtp.test----].txt` 
- This is a test file and it is required to pass the tests
